				<p>Welcome to Fortuna 13, an immersive roleplay experience for those seeking to appreciate the dangers of a post-apocalyptic wasteland! This is a simplified list of our server rules; they are by no means exhaustive, and ultimately the ruling is up to the administrator. For the full list of rules, please visit our Wiki:<br>
https://f13wiki.herma.moe/index.php/Rules
<br>
If you have questions, submit an adminhelp (F1) and ask us!<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 0: Common Sense and Courtesy</strong><br>
<br>
0.1) Act in good faith. The spirit of a rule supersedes its wording.<br>
0.2) Do not spam, troll, grief, or otherwise intentionally ruin the game for others.<br>
0.3) Do not harass other players. If someone expresses OOC discomfort, stop immediately and rethink what you are doing. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated.<br>
0.4) Do not intentionally spark drama or arguments. Do your best to keep the peace.<br>
0.5) Do not use slurs under any circumstance. Bigotry is strictly prohibited.<br>
0.6) Do not share in-character events from an ongoing round through OOC means.<br>
0.7) Cooperate with staff when ticketed. Do not lie or verbally abuse staff in a ticket. If a staff member tells you to do something in an administrative capacity, you must comply.<br>
0.8) Respect the rulings of staff members. If you want to contest a ruling, file a ticket on the server Discord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 1: Immersion and Atmosphere</strong><br>
<br>
1.1) Do not break immersion for other players. Maintain the atmosphere of the Fallout setting at all times.<br>
1.2) Do not reference elements of modern culture in-character. Fallout canon diverges from real life around the 1950s. Memes have no place in our setting.<br>
1.3) Name your characters appropriately. Your character name must be suitable for the setting and atmosphere of Fallout. It is up to staff discretion whether or not a name is appropriate for the setting.<br>
1.4) Do not explicitly reference OOC mechanics such as respawning, AHELPing, admin-healing,  round timers, etc. When in doubt, use LOOC, or obscure your language such that it fits within the setting and does not hurt immersion.<br>
1.5) Do not play combat-heavy roles if you are not confident in your ability to fight. A Veteran Ranger dying to radroaches is immersion-breaking.<br>
1.6) No End-of Round Grief (EORG) outside of the train. Maintain immersion until the round ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 2: Heavy Roleplay Standards</strong><br>
<br>
2.1) Fortuna is a roleplay-heavy server. Players must be fluent in English and capable of coherent communication.<br>
2.2) Continuity and canon persists between rounds. You are expected to recall past relations and interactions. Events may only be decanonized if all players involved agree, or if staff deem it necessary.<br>
2.3) You must roleplay a consistent character and respond to in-character events like a real person would. Characters that are deemed unrealistic or unsuitable to Falloutâ€™s setting may be subject to administrative action.<br>
2.4) You are NOT the protagonist. You may not play a Mary Sue. Your character must have strengths and weaknesses, and these should be demonstrated through your roleplay.<br>
2.5) Metaknowledge is prohibited; your character may only possess knowledge that they would reasonably attain, either through their background or through in-character events. There is a separation between what you as a player know, and what your character knows.<br>
2.6) Do not hop between roles or factions without in-character progression and strong reasoning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 3: Mechanics</strong><br>
<br>
3.1) In all cases, roleplay supersedes mechanics. Do not prioritize mechanics over roleplay; treat them as a supplement to RP.<br>
3.2) Do not powergame. Powergaming is defined as abusing game mechanics in a way that is damaging to roleplay, especially in a way that is unrealistic for a character to be capable of.<br>
3.3) Do not utilize exploits, do not share exploits with other players. Report them privately to staff or our development team.<br>
3.4) Do not mechanically engage with players who are SSD, AFK, or otherwise unresponsive but alive.<br>
3.5) You may not behead someone without at least one emote describing the action, as well as ample in-character reasoning.<br>
3.6) Off-duty roles must not act as regular on-duty faction members. Off-duty personnel must defer authority to those on-duty. Do not pull rank when off-duty.<br>
3.7) Faction members must wear faction armor in combat. They may not discard their faction armor in favor of unaffiliated or generic armor. Painting generic armor in faction colors does not quality it as faction armor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 4: Escalation and Combat</strong><br>
<br>
4.1) In nearly all circumstances, combat MUST have ample escalation and in-character justification. Do not escalate on another player without strong IC reasoning.<br>
4.2) Do not use bolas without escalating. Never throw a bola without activating combat mode. Un-escalated bolas will be punished as harshly as any other form of poorly-escalated combat.<br>
4.3) Do not handcuff others without escalating, either via verbal warning or an emote that clearly presents your intention to handcuff them.<br>
4.4) If a player flees from active escalation, they may be attacked immediately.<br>
4.5) If more than two minutes pass between combat, players are required to re-escalate.<br>
4.6) Faction members may join fights involving other faction members if and only if both participants are wearing their faction uniform, with their tags (if applicable) clearly visible.<br>
4.7) Base raids, faction or player, require explicit permission from online staff. If you wish to raid a base you must AHELP for permission.<br>
4.8) Do not escalate on or steal from other players without provocation until at least 30 minutes into the round. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule 5: Mature Content</strong><br>
<br>
5.1) This is an 18+ community. Underage users will be swiftly removed, without exception.<br>
5.2) Mature content is permitted. This includes erotic roleplay. Explicit consent is required before engaging in sexual content, either in-character, in OOC notes, or in LOOC. Consent may be withdrawn at any point.<br>
5.3) Non-consensual Erotic Roleplay is forbidden. No non-consensual ERP may take place between any player characters. Given the nature of the setting, sexual assault and similar content still exists within the universe and it may still be used as part of a character's backstory, but it should never take place on our server or be canonized between player characters.<br>
5.4) Extreme content is not permitted. This includes (but is not limited to) any depiction of sexual gore, scatophilia, pedophilia, vorarephilia, or bestiality. Keep it off our server.<br>
5.5) Do not include oversexualized descriptions in flavortexts. Any explicit reference art must be clearly marked as NSFW.<br>
<br>
